Welcome to my small AI app ‚Äì a showcase of interactive AI-powered applications built with Streamlit!

This project brings together real-time **emotion detection** from images or webcam feed, **image caption generation** capabilities, as well as **sentiment analysis**, demonstrating how modern AI models can be integrated into intuitive web applications.

### Features Included:

- **Image Caption Generator** powered by BLIP
- **Multilingual Text Assistant** with FLAN-T5 by Google
- **Sentiment Analyzer** for headlines, tweets, or articles
- **Fun Zone** full of surprises: emojis, fireworks, music, easter eggs!

### Technologies Used:
- Python, Streamlit & Anaconda
- DeepFace for facial analysis
- Hugging Face Transformers: `blip`, `flan-t5`, `roberta-sentiment`

‚ùóüö® **Note**:

Please be patient ‚Äî they're worth the wait! :)
